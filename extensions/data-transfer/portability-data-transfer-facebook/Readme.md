### Create a Facebook app
Before getting started, you will need a [Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/apps), and you will need to request the required [permissions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference) as per the data type.

### Permissions

- Photos export - [user_photos](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/user_photos/)
- Videos export - [user_videos](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/user_videos/)
- Posts export - [user_posts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/user_posts/)
- Notes export - [user_posts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/user_posts/)

### Keys & Auth
Facebook uses OAuth 2 for authorization.

Under your Facebook app's Settings (Basic), you can find the _App ID_ and _App Secret_, which you can use as the OAuth `App Key` and `Secret` for authentication, as described in [Keys](../../../Documentation/Keys.md).
